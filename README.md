[BF4] Insane Limits V0.9.8.0 Reserve Slot for Server Starter 

It has come to my attention, mainly through fellow server owners and clan members, that it can be very difficult to start a server from empty. With this set of limits, I aim to reward anyone who help start my server with a reserved slot so that if and when they come back to the server when it is full, they do not have to queue to get in.

**How it works:**

It starts off by creating a temp list of players on the server when the server population is 4 or more.

If the server population drops below 4 the list is destroyed.

If the server population gets above 10 then it copies the first 6 players from the temp list that are still in the server to reserve list, and gives them a potential 5 days on the reserve slot but the slot is not given to them yet. The temp list is also destroyed at this point. These  potential 5 days expire day by day.

If a player comes back within 5 days to help again then he is given another 5 days on top of whatever days he has left and is now rewarded with a reserve slot. There are some yell messages in here to but you can find them in the code. :D

This limit set has an expiry that if the player stop helping to start the server once they have a reserve slot then their name will be taken off the reserve slot after their days are up.
